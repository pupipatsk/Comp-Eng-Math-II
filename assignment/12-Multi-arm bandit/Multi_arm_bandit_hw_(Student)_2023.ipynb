        "Frequentist and Bayesian A/B tests require you to divide your traffic into arbitrary groups for a period of time, then perform statistical tests based on the results. By definition, this forces us to divert out traffic to suboptimal variations during the test period, resulting in lower overall conversion rates. On the other hand, multi-barmed bandit appraoch (MAB) dynamically adjusts the percentage of traffic shown to each variation according to how they have performed so far during the test, resulting in smaller loss in conversion rates.\n",
